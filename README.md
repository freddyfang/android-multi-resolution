# Multi-resolution generator

We should use dp/sp in android development cause it will be auto-scaled depends on devices' screen resolution. However, it's not always looks so good. Suppose we have a design that is based on a device with 250dp width, and there is a 25dp width button on it. Everything looks great until we run our app on a bigger device with 500dp width. Now our button looks 1/2 smaller than we expected.

This script can automactially generate other dimens for you. For example, we now will have two dimens.xml, one is defined by youself:

**dimens.xml**
```
  <dimen name="btn_width">25dp</dimen>
```

and another one will be generated by the script:

**dimens.xml(sw500dp)**
```
  <dimen name="btn_width">50dp</dimen>
```

## How to Use

1. Place script under your project `app` folder.
2. In app level `build.gradle`, add following line at the very bottom.
  ```
    apply from: 'multires.gradle'
  ```
3. Customize the script in `ext` section.
```
  ext {
    base_swdp = 250     // 250dp by default
    min_swdp = 250      // 250dp by default
    max_swdp = 1000     // 1000dp by default
    res_step = 10       // 10dp by default
  }
```
4. Run gradle sync, after that, you will see the script generate dimens.xml from {min_swdp} to {max_swdp}, step by {res_step}.
